# 🏋️‍♂️ GymBuddy — Match with your perfect gym partner!

🚧 **UNDER CONSTRUCTION** 🚧  
This project is currently like my biceps — *growing slowly but surely.*  
If something breaks… don’t worry, it’s **bulking season** 💪😅

-----

## ✅ What This Will Do (when it stops skipping leg day)
✔ Help users find gym partners  
✔ Match based on goals, schedule & location  
✔ Make working out less lonely and more fun  
✔ Possibly guilt-trip lazy people (still deciding)

-----

## ✅ What Works Right Now
- ✅ React + Vite frontend (it actually loads… miracle)
- ✅ Login & Signup pages (no fake protein required)
- ✅ MongoDB Atlas connected  
- ✅ Backend running with Express + JWT auth

-----

## 🔜 Coming Soon
- 🔥 Matchmaking feature (Tinder, but for dumbbells)
- 💬 Real-time chat (roast your gym partner live)
- 🧬 User profiles & fitness goals
- 📱 Super cool UI (maybe… one day…)
- 🚀 Deployment on Vercel + Render
